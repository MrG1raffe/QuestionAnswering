      "- Eric Forman Lead character Eric Forman was absent for all of That '70s Show season 8 until the last few minutes of the series finale. In his final arc of the series, Eric was sent to Africa to teach for a year and earn free tuition for college. This was when Topher Grace left That '70s Show at the end of season 7. Set in the 1970s, That '70s Show is a teen sitcom about a teenager named Eric Forman and his friends, who spend most of their time hanging out in Eric's basement, much to his mom Kitty's delight and his dad Red's dismay. Donna is Eric's longtime best friend and next-door neighbor, who becomes his on-and-off girlfriend. Topher Grace's Eric Forman finally left That '70s Show in season 7, one year before the show ended. However, his perfect ending came a year earlier. Although Topher Grace did eventually leave That '70s Show at the end of season 7, his Eric Forman character should have been written out of the sitcom a year earlier. While many fans of That '70s Show dislike its co-protagonist, Eric Forman (Topher Grace), for his decision to leave his fiancée Donna Pinciotti (Laura Prepon) at the altar in the Season 6 finale, \"The Seeker,\" a deeper look at the events of Season 6 leading up to the event reveals a more complicated situation than the surface-level read would im\n",

      "- Watch on Newton's First Law: Inertia An object at rest remains at rest, and an object in motion remains in motion at constant speed and in a straight line unless acted on by an unbalanced force. Introduction. When a body is free to rotate around an axis, torque must be applied to change its angular momentum.The amount of torque needed to cause any given angular acceleration (the rate of change in angular velocity) is proportional to the moment of inertia of the body.Moments of inertia may be expressed in units of kilogram metre squared (kg·m 2) in SI units and pound-foot-second \n",
      "- Kinetic energy formula. The kinetic energy formula defines the relationship between the mass of an object and its velocity. The kinetic energy KE equation is as follows: KE = 0.5 × m × v². where: m — Mass; and. v — Velocity. With the kinetic energy formula, you can estimate how much energy is needed to move an object. The book definition of centripetal force tells us that it's the force that acts on any object that moves along a curved path. The direction of the force is always parallel to the curvature's radius r. \n",

      "- One of the great storytelling songs of his career was a song called \"One Piece at a Time\" where in the song, Johnny moves to Detroit, Michigan to work for GM on the assembly line and decides that he's going to steal a car but do it over many years, one piece at a time. Get our free mobile app Advertisement The Legendary Journey of Johnny Cash's \"One Piece at a Time\" Car by Toms | Jul 4, 2023 | Country Music Johnny Cash's iconic \"One Piece at a Time\" car has been sitting in a museum for decades; the car has been assembled with unusual and unusual parts over the years. Johnny Cash's \"One Piece at a Time,\" a country novelty song, takes listeners on a unique journey through the world of automotive dreams and craftsmanship. Written by Wayne Kemp and released in 1976, this humorous and iconic track showcases a creative approach to acquiring the car of one's dreams. The satirical edge of 'One Piece at a Time' is pervasive, encapsulating the lengths to which people will go to attain status symbols. Cash uses humor to comment on consumer culture, fetishization of commodities, and the working-class experience in a post-industrial age. Additionally, the song indirectly examines the idea of authenticity. The Johnny Cash song about a car is \"One Piece at a Time.\" The 1976 single was the last of his recordings to reach Number 1 on the country charts and the last of his to cross over into the Billboard Top 100 for pop songs. \n",

      "Search result:\n",
      "- The fibula is a slender, cylindrical leg bone that is located on the posterior portion of the limb. It is found next to another long bone known as the tibia. A long bone is defined as one whose body is longer than it is wide. Like other long bones, the fibula has a proximal end (with a head and neck), a shaft, and a distal end. Anatomy There are two bones in the lower leg, below the knee. The larger of the two bones is the tibia. It is the shin bone and bears the majority of weight between the knee and the ankle. Lateral to (on the outer side of) the tibia is the fibula, a smaller long bone that provides stability and assists with rotation of the ankle. The fibula is a long bone in the lower extremity that is positioned on the lateral side of the tibia. The fibula is much smaller and thinner than the tibia. It is located just behind the tibial head at the knee joint and then runs down the lateral aspect of the leg until it reaches the ankle joint. The tibia runs medial to the fibula from just below the knee joint to the ankle joint and is connected to the fibula by the interosseous membrane. [2] The proximal portion of the tibia consists of a medial and lateral condyle, which combine to form the inferior portion of the knee joint. The leg is the region of the lower limb between the knee and the foot. It comprises two bones: the tibia and the fibula. The role of these two bones is to provide stability and support to the rest of the body, and through articulations with the femur and foot/ankle and the muscles attached to these bones, provide mobility and the ability to ambulate in an upright position.

Apart from the function of defense, the wall also boosted the economy, as well as promoted the culture exchange and national integration of different nations at its two sides. What is the Great Wall of China mainly built for? The most extensive and best-preserved version of the wall dates from the Ming dynasty (1368-1644) and runs for some 5,500 miles (8,850 km) east to west from Mount Hu near Dandong, southeastern Liaoning province, to Jiayu Pass west of Jiuquan, northwestern Gansu province. Xianbei in Jin Dynasty (265 - 420 AD) Many historians think the Jin Dynasty is one of the dynasties in China history that did not help build the Great Wall.

      "- Kolkata history An Irish priest in Calcutta and the mysterious translator of 'Nil Darpan' It still remains a mystery if it was Michael Madhusudan Dutt who actually translated the play in English on Rev. James Long's request Trinanjan Chakraborty | Published 08.08.23, 04:13 PM The bust of James Long in Kolkata Wikimedia Commons The English translation of the play 'Neel Darpan' was published by Reverend James Long. He was a British Christian missionary who served in India and was a strong advocate of Indian rights. The play, originally written in Bengali by Dinabandhu Mitra in 1858-1859, highlighted the atrocities committed by indigo planters on Indian farmers. Michael Madhusudan Dutt translated Dinabandhu Mitra's play Nil Darpan into English. He also translated some dramas and his own Sharmistha in English. During his early literary career, he published two books in English while in Madras.
